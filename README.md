# deep_learning_brain_project
## Purpose of the project
The goal of the project is to prepare a skull stripping method on T1-type magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences of the head. The method should extract the entire area occupied by the actual brain from the patient's raw scan, omitting bones, other soft tissues, etc.
